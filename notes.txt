function to hide the start button once clicked
function to show the quiz container once start button is clicked

event listener for the start button click

function that starts a timer 

create variables from html elements that the javascript will edit

when the start button is clicked and the container is showing, 
I want the content to change within each section of the container: question and answer choices

*** before starting next homework assignment, write out the logic from the user story/requirements ***

1. in the h3, append pulling content from questions variable... the first question's title from the array list
2. In the choice-container, choice-text -number 1, append pulling content from questions variable... the first question's choices[0] in the array list
3. Repeat that for the other 3 choices
4. Function to alert quiz taker if they selected the correct answer or not
	* Correct answer will show a "Correct" message and run the nextQuestion function
	* Wrong answer will show a "wrong" message and run a function that removes 10 seconds from timer

~correct/wrong answer~ are those coded in as invisible in the HTML and turn on when the correct answer is selected~
